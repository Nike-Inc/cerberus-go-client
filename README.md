# Cerberus Go Client
This library is a port of the [official Cerberus Python client](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/cerberus-python-client).

## Roadmap
Currently, we are only implementing the `UserAuth` type for authenticating to the API.
The AWS Auth has been stubbed out and will be implemented in the future
